### Learning Goals:
The aim of this exercise is to experiment around component life cycle. In this exercise, we will experiment around majorly three basic component life-cycles - 

1. componentDidMount()
2. componentDidUpdate
3. componentWillUnmount()

The entire code is already written for you. Your task is just to clone this project and run this project, and understand how each component life cycle is working. 
You are free to experiment around and add other life cycle methods too.
